# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This project is a modern web application with a React frontend and a Firebase backend.

## Project Structure

- `frontend/`: Contains the React frontend application.
- `backend/`: Contains the Firebase functions for the backend logic.
- `firebase.json`: Configures Firebase hosting and functions.

## Current Plan

- Set up the basic project structure with separate `frontend` and `backend` folders.
- Configure Firebase for hosting and functions.
- Create placeholder files for backend functions.
- Install dependencies for both `frontend` and `backend`.
